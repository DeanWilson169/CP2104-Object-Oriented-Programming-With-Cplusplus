This Assignment was written entirely within Visual Studio Code so there are no solution files.

Unfortunately i had issues splitting up the code into seperate files.
I agree at this point each class should have it's own .Cpp and .H files but as i 
started this project in VS Code i ran into issues compiling seperate files within VS code and I also couldn't get the program to work again
after trying to migrate it to VS Studio. So apologies for the rediculously large source file.
Also i ran into some issues with menu option 6 taking a really long time sometimes. I could not work out how to fix that.
It does work though.
