A light rigid plane used in aerial navigation to oppose sudden upward or downward movement in the air as in gliding machines; specif. such a plane slightly inclined and driven forward as a lifting device in some flying machines. Also called airfoil;  hence a heavier-than-air flying machine using such a device to provide lift. In a modern aeroplane the airfoils are called the wings and most of the lift is derived from these surfaces. In contrast to helicopters the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus such a machine is called a fixed-wing aircraft. These machines are called monoplanes biplanes triplanes or quadruplanes according to the number of main supporting planes (wings) used in their construction. After 1940 few planes with more than one airfoil were constructed and these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes. Being heavier than air they depend for their levitation on motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers driven by an engine or in a jet plane by the reaction from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward from a jet engine. They start from the ground by a run on small wheels or runners and are guided by a steering apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable planes which usually form part of the wings or tail. There are many varieties of form and construction which in some cases are known by the names of their inventors. In U.S. an aeroplane is usually called an airplane or plane.<br>

Any one of various soils found in arid and semiarid regions containing an unusual amount of soluble mineral salts which effloresce in the form of a powder or crust (usually white) in dry weather following rains or irrigation. The basis of these salts is mainly soda with a smaller amount of potash and usually a little lime and magnesia. Two main classes of alkali are commonly distinguished: black alkali which may be any alkaline carbonate but which practically consists of sodium carbonate (sal soda) which is highly corrosive and destructive to vegetation; and white alkali characterized by the presence of sodium sulphate (Glauber's salt) which is less injurious to vegetation. Black alkali is so called because water containing it dissolves humus forming a dark-colored solution which when it collects in puddles and evaporates produces characteristic black spots.<br>
