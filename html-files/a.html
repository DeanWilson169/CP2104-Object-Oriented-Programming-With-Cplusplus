      a<br>
      The first letter of the English and of many other alphabets. The capital A of the alphabets of Middle and Western Europe as also the small letter (a) besides the forms in Italic black letter etc. are all descended from the old Latin A which was borrowed from the Greek Alpha of the same form; and this was made from the first letter (?) of the Phoenician alphabet the equivalent of the Hebrew Aleph and itself from the Egyptian origin. The Aleph was a consonant letter with a guttural breath sound that was not an element of Greek articulation; and the Greeks took it to represent their vowel Alpha with the a sound the Phoenician alphabet having no vowel symbols;  The name of the sixth tone in the model major scale (that in C) or the first tone of the minor scale which is named after it the scale in A minor. The second string of the violin is tuned to the A in the treble staff. -- A sharp (A?) is the name of a musical tone intermediate between A and B. -- A flat (A?) is the name of a tone intermediate between A and G;  An adjective commonly called the indefinite article and signifying one or any but less emphatically; In each; to or for each; as �twenty leagues a day� �a hundred pounds a year� �a dollar a yard� etc;  In; on; at; by; In process of; in the act of; into; to; -- used with verbal substantives in -ing which begin with a consonant. This is a shortened form of the preposition an (which was used before the vowel sound); as in a hunting a building a begging;  Of;  A barbarous corruption of have of he and sometimes of it and of they;  An expletive void of sense to fill up the meter.<br>

      aeroplane<br>
      A light rigid plane used in aerial navigation to oppose sudden upward or downward movement in the air as in gliding machines; specif. such a plane slightly inclined and driven forward as a lifting device in some flying machines. Also called airfoil;  hence a heavier-than-air flying machine using such a device to provide lift. In a modern aeroplane the airfoils are called the wings and most of the lift is derived from these surfaces. In contrast to helicopters the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus such a machine is called a fixed-wing aircraft. These machines are called monoplanes biplanes triplanes or quadruplanes according to the number of main supporting planes (wings) used in their construction. After 1940 few planes with more than one airfoil were constructed and these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes. Being heavier than air they depend for their levitation on motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers driven by an engine or in a jet plane by the reaction from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward from a jet engine. They start from the ground by a run on small wheels or runners and are guided by a steering apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable planes which usually form part of the wings or tail. There are many varieties of form and construction which in some cases are known by the names of their inventors. In U.S. an aeroplane is usually called an airplane or plane.<br>

      Any one of various soils found in arid and semiarid regions containing an unusual amount of soluble mineral salts which effloresce in the form of a powder or crust (usually white) in dry weather following rains or irrigation. The basis of these salts is mainly soda with a smaller amount of potash and usually a little lime and magnesia. Two main classes of alkali are commonly distinguished: black alkali which may be any alkaline carbonate but which practically consists of sodium carbonate (sal soda) which is highly corrosive and destructive to vegetation; and white alkali characterized by the presence of sodium sulphate (Glauber's salt) which is less injurious to vegetation. Black alkali is so called because water containing it dissolves humus forming a dark-colored solution which when it collects in puddles and evaporates produces characteristic black spots.<br>

      alpha-rays<br>
      Rays of relatively low penetrating power emitted by radium and other radioactive substances and shown to consist of positively charged alpha particles (helium nuclei) having enormous velocities but small masses. They are slightly deflected by a strong magnetic or electric field. Compare beta ray and gamma ray. Because the rays penetrate only a small distance in dense matter such as living tissue small pellets of radioactive substances emitting alpha rays have been used to cause local destruction of tissue as in cancer therapy.<br>

      anopheles<br>
      A genus of mosquitoes which are secondary hosts of the malaria parasites and whose bite is the usual if not the only means of infecting human beings with malaria. Several species are found in the United States. They may be distinguished from the ordinary mosquitoes of the genus Culex by the long slender palpi nearly equaling the beak in length while those of the female Culex are very short. They also assume different positions when resting Culex usually holding the body parallel to the surface on which it rests and keeping the head and beak bent at an angle while Anopheles holds the body at an angle with the surface and the head and beak in line with it. Unless they become themselves infected by previously biting a subject affected with malaria the insects cannot transmit the disease.<br>
