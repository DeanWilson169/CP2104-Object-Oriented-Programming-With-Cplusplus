      palimpsest<br>
      A parchment which has been written upon twice the first writing having been erased to make place for the second. The erasures of ancient writings were usually carried on in monasteries to allow the production of ecclesiastical texts such as copies of church services and lives of the saints. The difficulty of recovering the original text varied with the process used to prepare the parchment for a fresh writing; the original texts on parchments which had been washed with lime-water and dried were easily recovered by a chemical process but those erased by scraping the parchment and bleaching are difficult to interpret. Most of the manuscripts underlying the palimpsests that have been revived are fragmentary but some are of great historical value. One Syriac version of the Four Gospels was discovered in 1895 in St. Catherine's Monastery at Mount Sinai by Mrs. Agnes Smith Lewis. See also the notes below.<br>

      paracelsus<br>
      Philippus Aureolus Paracelsus (originally Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim also called Theophrastus Paracelsus and Theophrastus von Hohenheim). Born at Maria-Einsiedeln in the Canton of Schwyz Switzerland Dec. 17 (or 10 Nov.) 1493: died at Salzburg Sept. 23 (or 24) 1541. A celebrated German-Swiss physician reformer of therapeutics iatrochemist and alchemist. He attended school in a small lead-mining district where his father William Bombast von Hohenheim was a physician and teacher of alchemy. The family originally came from Wurtemberg where the noble family of Bombastus was in possession of the ancestral castle of Hohenheim near Stuttgart until 1409. He entered the University of Basel at the age of sixteen where he adopted the name Paracelsus after Celsius a noted Roman physician. But he left without a degree first going to Wurtzburg to study under Joannes Trithemius Abbot of Sponheim (1462-1516) a famous astrologer and alchemist who initiated him into the mysteries of alchemy. He then spent many years in travel and intercourse with distinguished scholars studied and practiced medicine and surgery and at one point attended the Diet of Worms. He was appointed to the office of city physician of Basel which also made him a lecturer on medicine at Basel about 1526 where through the publisher Johan Frobenius he made friends with the scholar Erasmus; and there he fulminated against the medical pseudo-science of his day and against the blind adherence to ancient medical authorities such as Hippocrates Galen and Avicenna which was still the prevalent philosophy of medicine in the sixteenth century. But soon in 1528 he was driven from the city by the medical corporations whose methods he had severely criticized. He found refuge with friends and traveled and practiced medicine but could not find a publisher willing to print his books. He preached frequently the need for experimentation in medicine. He is important in the history of medicine chiefly on account of the impetus which he gave to the development of pharmaceutical chemistry. He was also the author of a visionary and theosophic system of philosophy. The first collective edition of his works appeared at Basel in 1589-91. Among the many legends concerning him is that concerning his long sword which he obtained while serving as barber-surgeon during the Neapolitan wars. It was rumored that in the hilt of the sword he kept a familiar or small demon; some thought he carried the elixer of life in the sword. He is buried in the cemetary of the Hospital of St. Sebastian in Salzburg. For more detailed information about Paracelsus there is a special project the Zurich Paracelsus Project available on the Web.<br>

It is used in candles as a sealing agent (such as in canning of preserves) as a waterproofing agent as an illuminant and as a lubricant. It is very inert not being acted upon by most of the strong chemical reagents. It was formerly regarded as a definite compound but is now known to be a complex mixture of several higher hydrocarbons of the methane or marsh-gas series; hence by extension any substance whether solid liquid or gaseous of the same chemical series; thus gasoline coal gas and kerosene consist largely of paraffins.<br>

      The bit within a data structure which is assigned a value of 1 or 0 so as to make the parity{7} of the data structure odd or even. Data structures may or may not have parity bits dpending on whether the system does or does not perform parity checking. The most commonly used parity bit is the eigth (higher-order) bit of a byte which is used when data transmission uses only the 7 lower-order bits of each byte as significant data; some memory systems use a ninth bit as a parity bit for each eight bits (one byte) of significant data in memory.<br>

      The act or process of testing whether a byte or other data structure has an even or odd number of bits set to the value of 1; -- it is used primarily to detect errors in data especially in memory banks or in data transmitted over a communications line. The parity can be changed by assigning one bit in each data structure as the parity bit so that the total number of bits set to the value of 1 is odd (odd parity) or even (even parity). If parity is used for error checking the writing and reading systems must first agree on which type of parity (odd or even) to use; if the reading system detects a deviation from the agreed parity it signals an error to be handled by the error-handling processes of the system.<br>

      patrole<br>
      See Patrol n. & v. - V the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet is a vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character U being the cursive form while V is better adapted for engraving as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel ? (see Y) this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F) or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u w f b p; as in vine wine; avoirdupois habit have; safe save; trover troubadour trope. See U F etc;  As a numeral V stands for five in English and Latin.<br>

      penicillin<br>
      Any of a variety of substances having a structure containing a beta-lactam ring fused to a thiirane ring to which a carboxyl group is attached but most commonly interpreted as benzyl penicillin. They are notable as powerful antibacterial agents of relatively low toxicity which have found extensive use in medicine for treating bacterial infections. They are categorized as one of the classes of beta-lactam antibiotic. They are produced naturally by some fungi and bacteria and industrial production processes almost invariably start from some form of the penicillin nucleus produced by fermentation of microorganisms. The fermentation products are then chemically modified to produce derivatives of enhanced potency safety or antibacterial spectrum. The first penicillin to see extensive use clinically (during World War II) was penicillin G also called benzypenicillin and commonly simply �penicillin�.<br>

      penicillinase<br>
      An enzyme which destroys the antibacterial activity of penicillin by hydrolyzing the amide bond in the beta-lactam ring. Many penicillinases are known and are produced by a wide variety of bacteria. The production of penicillinase is one of the mechanisms by which bacteria may become resistant to penicillins. Penicillinase production in various bacterial species may be induced i.e. it may occur only when stimulated by the presence of penicillin in the culture medium or it may be constitutive i.e. it may occur whenever the cells are producing protein. Molecular weights of the various penicillinases tend to cluster near 50000.<br>

It is usually expressed in angular measure the cycle beb four right angles or 360�. Such periodic variations are generally well represented by sine curves; and phase relations are shown by the relative positions of the crests and hollows of such curves. Magnitudes which have the same phase are said to be in phase;  the relation at any instant of any cyclically varying physical quantity such as voltage in an A.C. circuit an electromagnetic wave a sound wave or a rotating object to its initial value as expressed as a fractional part of the complete cycle.

It may be stated thus: The degree of variableness (number of degrees of freedom) of a system is equal to the number of components minus the number of phases plus two. Thus if the components be salt and water and the phases salt ice saturated solution and vapor the system is invariant that is there is only one set of conditions under which these four phases can exist in equilibrium. If only three phases be considered the system is univariant that is the fixing of one condition as temperature determines the others.<br>

As the plate vibrates under the influence of a sound the stylus makes minute indentations or undulations in the soft material and these when the cylinder or disk is again turned set the plate in vibration and reproduce the sound;  an instrument for reproducing sounds especially music previously recorded on a plastic cylinder or disk as a pattern of bumps or wiggles in a groove. A needle (stylus) held in the groove is made to vibrate by motion (rotation) of the recording and the vibrations caused by the bumps and wiggles are transmitted directly to a membrane or first to an electronic amplifier circuit thereby reproducing with greater or less fidelity the original sounds. A phonograph which is equipped with electronics enabling the playback of sound with high fidelity to the original is often called a hi-fi.<br>

      photosynthesis<br>
      The process of constructive metabolism by which carbohydrates are formed from water vapor and the carbon dioxide of the air in the chlorophyll-containing tissues of plants exposed to the action of light. It was formerly called assimilation but this is now commonly used as in animal physiology. The details of the process are not yet clearly known. Baeyer's theory is that the carbon dioxide is reduced to carbon monoxide which uniting with the hydrogen of the water in the cell produces formaldehyde the latter forming various sugars through polymerization. Vines suggests that the carbohydrates are secretion products of the chloroplasts derived from decomposition of previously formed proteids. The food substances are usually quickly translocated those that accumulate being changed to starch which appears in the cells almost simultaneously with the sugars. The chloroplasts perform photosynthesis only in light and within a certain range of temperature varying according to climate. This is the only way in which a plant is able to organize carbohydrates. All plants without a chlorophyll apparatus as the fungi must be parasitic or saprophytic.<br>

The species was renamed Homo erectus around 1960. The Javan bones are believed to be from 1.6 to 1.9 million years old and include a thigh bone of the human type two molar teeth intermediate between those of man and the anthropoids and the calvaria of the skull indicating a brain capacity of about 900 cubic centimeters and resembling in form that of the Neanderthal man. Additional specimens of what are considerd as variants of the species have been found in China Africa and Europe. Homo erectus is currently believed to have evolved in Africa from Homo habilis the first member of the genus Homo. Anatomically and physiologically Homo erectus resembles contemporary humans except for having a stouter bone structure.<br>

      A piece of DNA usually circular functioning as part of the genetic material of a cell not integrated with the chromosome and replicating independently of the chromosome but transferred like the chromosome to subsequent generations of daughter cells. In bacteria plasmids often carry the genes for antibiotic resistance; they are exploited in genetic engineering as the vehicles for introduction of extraneous DNA into cells to alter the genetic makeup of the cell. The cells thus altered may produce desirable proteins which are extracted and used; in the case of genetically altered plant cells the altered cells may grow into complete plants with changed properties as for example increased resistance to disease.<br>

      plate-tectonics<br>
      A geological theory which holds that the crust of the earth (the lithosphere) is divided into a small number of large separate plates which float and move slowly around on the more plastic asthenosphere breaking apart and moving away from each other at points where magma upwells from below and driven by such upwellings and other currents on the athenosphere sliding past each other colliding with each other and in some cases being submerged (subducted) one below the other. This theory is now widely accepted and explains many geological phenomena such as the clustered locations of earthquakes mountain building volcanism and the similarities observed between the geology of continents such as South America and Africa which are now far apart but according to the theory were once joined together. The motions of such tectonic plates are very slow typically only several centimeters per year but over tens and hundreds of millions of years cause very large changes in the relative positions of the continents. The consequence of such movement of plates is called continental drift.<br>

      polonium<br>
      A radioactive chemical element discovered by M. and MMe. Curie in pitchblende and originally called radium F. It has atomic number 84 and an atomic weight of 210. It is a very rare natural element having an abundance in uranium ores only 0.2% that of radium. It is closely related chemically to bismuth. It emits only alpha rays and has a half-life of 138 days. It is thus more unstable than radium and a milligram of polonium emits as many alpha particles as 5 grams of radium. Twenty-seven isotopes are known with atomic masses from 192 to 218. At present a more practical method of preparation than isolation from ores is the preparation by neutron bombardment of bismuth in a nuclear reactor and it may be obtained commercially by users having an appropriate permit.<br>

      post-impressionism<br>
      In the broadest sense the theory or practice of any of several groups of painters of the early 1900's or of these groups taken collectively whose work and theories have in common a tendency to reaction against the scientific and naturalistic character of impressionism and neo-impressionism. In a strict sense the term post-impressionism is used to denote the effort at self-expression rather than representation shown in the work of Cezanne Matisse etc.; but it is more broadly used to include cubism the theory or practice of a movement in both painting and sculpture which lays stress upon volume as the important attribute of objects and attempts its expression by the use of geometrical figures or solids only; and futurism a theory or practice which attempts to place the observer within the picture and to represent simultaneously a number of consecutive movements and impressions. In practice these theories and methods of the post-impressionists change with great rapidity and shade into one another so that a picture may be both cubist and futurist in character. They tend to and sometimes reach a condition in which both representation and traditional decoration are entirely abolished and a work of art becomes a purely subjective expression in an arbitrary and personal language.<br>
