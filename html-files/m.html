      The striped mullet of California (Mugil cephalus syn. Mugil Mexicanus);  Manly especially with an assertive and domineering manner toward women;  A form of dark matter in distant outer space unobservable except by its gravitational effect and believed to be at least part of the �missing matter� which is unobservable as ordinary stars but helps keep galaxies from flying apart; MACHOS are massive but compact objects such as neutron stars or brown dwarfs which can be detected (with difficulty) by their effect in bending light from distant light sources such as other galaxies. This can occur if by rare chance a MACHO passes in front of a more distant visible object and the light from that object becomes temporarily amplified by the MACHO acting as a gravitational lens. Some MACHOs have been discovered in the halo of dark matter that surrounds our milky way. It is however questionable whether the amount of such matter is sufficient to explain the ability of galaxies to stay together in spite of rotation rates that would cause them to fly apart if the only matter present was that observable as visible stars.<br>

      a medical diagnostic procedure utilizing the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance to generate images of internal parts of the body. It depends on the differential absorption of electromagnetic radiation by different types of living tissue in a magnetic field. It is complementary to X-ray imaging in that the softer tissue show more prominently in magnetic resonance images rather than bone as with X-rays. It is a non-invasive procedure allowing such images to be obtained without penetration of the tissue by objects. It is abbreviated MRI. As with computerized tomography the results are usually presented as images of sequential planar sections of that part of the body of concern to the physician.<br>

      An optical device for making an indicator diagram for high-speed engines. It consists of a light-tight box or camera having at one end a small convex mirror which reflects a beam of light on to the ground glass or photographic plate at the other end. The mirror is pivoted so that it can be moved in one direction by a small plunger operated by an elastic metal diaphragm which closes a tube connected with the engine cylinder. It is also moved at right angles to this direction by a reducing motion called a reproducer so as to copy accurately on a smaller scale the motion of the engine piston. The resultant of these two movements imparts to the reflected beam of light a motion similar to that of the pencil of the ordinary indicator and this can be traced on the sheet of ground glass or photographed.<br>

      melatonin<br>
      A hormone secreted by the pineal gland. Chemically it is N-acety-5-methoxytryptamine. Research has indicated that there are daily rhythms in secretion of melatonin in particular due to the depressing effect on melatonin production by light received by the retina. Conversely it appears that melatonin may influence the circadian rhythms of animals. There is some experimental evidence that administration of melatonin may increase the amount of sleep in people with sleep disorders. However the evidence is not convincing and the effect is not profound. Nevertheless the deregulation of melatonin and its availability over-the-counter has led to many people taking melatonin to help sleep without consulting a physician.<br>

      mesothorium<br>
      a radioactive isotope of radium (radium-228) with a half-life of 5.8 years. Also called mesothorium-1 or mesothorium I to distinguish it from a subsequent decay product mesothorium II (actinium-228). It was discovered in 1907 by Otto Hahn as a decay product of thorium (produced by decay of thorium-232). Mesothorium-1 (radium-228) in turn produces actinium-228 (mesothorium-2) as the first product of its radioactive decay and the actinium-228 in turn decays quickly (half-life of 6 hours) to thorium-228 (which is also called radiothorium; the thorium-228 has a half-life of 1.91 years shorter than that of the radium-228). It was discovered and named before full recognition of the nature of isotopes of the elements and was distinguished from other variants of radium by its half-life and mode of production and decay. It was also cheaper to prepare than other short-lived radium isotopes and was thus sold commercially for use e.g. in making watch dials readable in the dark by painting the hands and hour marks with a self-luminous paint containing the radioactive substance; it is therefore often referred to (e.g. in regulatory legislation) as though distinct from radium. It was one of the isotopes believed responsible for radiation-induced diseases observed in industrial workers who painted radium on watch dials in the late 1950's and early 1960's. The primary isotope of radium (radium-226) has a half-life of 1620 years and these isotopes with shorter half-lives proved difficult to isolate and study for the purpose of finding the cause of such diseases.<br>

      A system of weights and measures originating in France the use of which is required by law in many countries and permitted in many others including the United States; the system is also called by its French name Le Systeme International de Unites (abbreviated SI). The principal unit of length is the meter (see Meter). From this are formed the are the liter the stere the gram etc. These units and others derived from them are divided decimally and larger units are formed from multiples by 10 100 1000 and 10000. The successive multiplies are designated by the prefixes deka- (formerly deca-) hecto- kilo- and myria- (seldom used); successive parts by deci- centi- and milli-. The prefixes mega- and micro- are used to denote a multiple by one million and the millionth part respectively; giga- and nano- denote multiples of one billion (1000000000) and one billionth respectively. The prefix for one trillion (1012) is tera and for one trillionth (10-12) is pico; for one quintillion (1015) peta and for (10-15) (one quintillionth) femto; for (10-18) atto.

      molecular-formula<br>
      An expression representing the composition of elements in a chemical substance commonly consisting of a series of letters and numbers comprising the atomic symbols of each element present in a compound followed by the number of atoms of that element present in one molecule of the substance. Thus the molecular formula for common alcohol (ethyl alcohol) is C2H6O meaning that each molecule contains two carbon atoms six hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The molecular formula may be written to provide some indication of the actual structure of the molecule in which case structural units may be written separately. Thus ethyl alcohol can also be written as CH3.CH2.OH or CH3-CH2-OH in which the period or dash between functional groups indicates a single bond between the principle atoms of each group. This formula shows that in ethyl alcohol the carbon of a methyl group (CH3-) is attached to the carbon of a methylene group (-CH2-) which is attached to the oxygen of a hydroxyl group (-OH). A structural formula is a graphical depiction of the relative positions of atoms in a molecule and may be very complicated.<br>

      montessori-method<br>
      A system of training and instruction primarily for use with normal children aged from three to six years devised by Dr. Maria Montessori while teaching in the �Houses of Childhood� (schools in the poorest tenement districts of Rome Italy) and first fully described by her in 1909. The fundamental aim is to create self-motivation for education and the leading features are freedom for physical activity (no stationary desks and chairs) informal and individual instruction the very early development of reading and writing skills and an extended sensory and motor training (with special emphasis on vision touch perception of movement and their interconnections) mediated by a patented standardized system of �didactic apparatus� which is declared to be �auto-regulative.� Most of the chief features of the method are borrowed from current methods used in many institutions for training feeble-minded children and dating back especially to the work of the French-American physician Edouard O. Seguin (1812-80).<br>

The metal catch is moved when a mouse tries to take a piece of bait attached to it releasing the loop which forcefully moves though an arc usually killing the mouse. A larger version of the same device is used as a rat trap.<br>
