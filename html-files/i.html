It combines systematically the advantages of previous schemes with a thoroughly logical word formation and has neither accented constants nor arbitrarily coined pronominal words. For each idea that root is selected which is already most international on the principle of the �greatest facility for the greatest number of people.� The word �Ido� means in the language itself �offspring.� The official name is: �Linguo Internaciona di la Delegitaro (Sistema Ido).�.<br>

      Same as inositol. - A white crystalline substance (C6H12O6) with a sweet taste widely distributed in certain animal tissues and fluids particularly in the muscles of the heart and lungs and also in some plants as in unripe pease beans potato sprouts etc. Although isomeric with dextrose it has no carbonyl (aldehyde or ketone) group and is therefore not a carbohydrate but a derivative of cyclohexane. Called also inosite cyclohexitol cyclohexanehexol hexahydroxycyclohexane and phaseomannite. There are nine possible steroisomers not all of which are found naturally. The predominate natural form is cis-1235-trans-46-cyclohexanehexol also called myo-inositol. The naturally occurring phytic acid in plants is the hexaphosphate of inositol from which inositol may be manufactured; phytin is the calcium-magnesium salt of phytic acid. It is also a component of phosphatidylinositol.<br>

      internal-combustion<br>
      Designating or pertaining to any engine (called an Internal-combustion engine) in which the heat or pressure energy necessary to produce motion is developed in the engine cylinder as by the explosion of a gas and not in a separate chamber as in a steam-engine boiler. The gas used may be a fixed gas or one derived from alcohol ether gasoline (petrol) naphtha oil (petroleum) etc. There are three main classes: (1) gas engines proper using fixed gases as coal blast-furnace or producer gas; (2) engines using the vapor of a volatile fluid as the typical gasoline (petrol) engine; (3) oil engines using either an atomized spray or the vapor (produced by heat) of a comparatively heavy oil as petroleum or kerosene. In all of these the gas is mixed with a definite amount of air the charge is composed in the cylinder and is then exploded either by a flame of gas (flame ignition -- now little used) by a hot tube (tube ignition) or the like by an electric spark (electric ignition the usual method is gasoline engines or by the heat of compression as in the Diesel engine. Gas and oil engines are chiefly of the stationary type. Gasoline engines are largely used for automobile vehicles boats etc. Most internal-combustion engines use the Otto (four-stroke) cycle though many use the two-stroke cycle. They are almost universally trunk engines and single-acting. Because of the intense heat produced by the frequent explosions the cylinders must be cooled by a water jacket (water-cooled) or by air currents (air cooled) to give the maximum thermodynamic efficiency and to avoid excessive friction or seizing.<br>

      An exclamation of joy or triumph; -- often interjectional;  In Greek mythology the beautiful daughter of Inachus king of Argos Greece who was changed by Hera (Juno) in a fit of jealousy into a white heifer and placed under the watch of Argus of the hundred eyes. When Argus was killed by Hermes at the command of Zeus the heifer was maddened by a terrible gadfly sent by Hera and wandered about until she arrived in Egypt. There she recovered her original shape and bore Epaphus to Zeus. Epaphus became the ancestor of AEgyptus Damaus Cepheus and Phineus. She was identified by the Egyptians with Isis. According to another legend Io was carried off by Phoenician traders who landed in Argos. The myth is generally explained to be Aah or the moon wandering in the starry skies symbolized by the hundred-eyed Argus; her transformation into a horned heifer representing the crescent moon; One of the large moons of the planet Jupiter remarkable for its intense volcanic activity as observed in fly-bys of space probes. It was named after the mythological Io.<br>

      ion<br>
      an atom or goup of atoms (radical) carrying an electrical charge. It is contrasted with neutral atoms or molecules and free radicals. Certain compounds such as sodium chloride are composed of complementary ions in the solid (crystalline) as well as in solution. Others notably acids such as hydrogen chloride may occur as neutral molecules in the pure liquid or gas forms and ionize almost completely in dilute aqueous solutions. In solutions (as in water) ions are frequently bound non-covalently with the molecules of solvent and in that case are said to be solvated. According to the electrolytic dissociation theory the molecules of electrolytes are divided into ions by water and other solvents. An ion consists of one or more atoms and carries one unit charges of electricity 3.4 x 10-10 electrostatic units or a multiple of this. Those which are positively electrified (hydrogen and the metals) are called cations; negative ions (hydroxyl and acidic atoms or groups) are called anions;  One of the small electrified particles into which the molecules of a gas are broken up under the action of the electric current of ultraviolet and certain other rays and of high temperatures. To the properties and behavior of ions the phenomena of the electric discharge through rarefied gases and many other important effects are ascribed. At low pressures the negative ions appear to be electrons; the positive ions atoms minus an electron. At ordinary pressures each ion seems to include also a number of attached molecules. Ions may be formed in a gas in various ways.<br>
