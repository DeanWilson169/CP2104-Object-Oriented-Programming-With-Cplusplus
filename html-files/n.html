Symbol N. Atomic weight 14.007. It was formerly regarded as a permanent noncondensible gas but was liquefied in 1877 by Cailletet of Paris and Pictet of Geneva and boils at -195.8 � C at atmospheric pressure.

      norium<br>
      A supposed metal alleged to have been discovered in 1845 by the Swedish chemist Swanberg in zircon. After many unsuccessful attempts to verify this new element the element named Hafnium (atomic number 72) was discoverd in 1923 by D. Coster and G. von Hevesey in the zirconium-containing mineral zircon. Hafnium present at 1 to 5% in many zirconium-bearing minerals but difficult to separate from zirconium is probably the element that gave rise to the properties attributed to the hypothetical norium.<br>

      nuclear-magnetic-resonance<br>
      The specific absorption and re-emission of electromagnetic radiation at characteristic wavelengths by atomic nuclei in a magnetic field. It is abbreviated NMR. The wavelength of the radiation absorbed depends on the type of nucleus the intensity of the magnetic field and the local chemical environment in which the nucleus resides. It is the latter effect (called the chemical shift) by which atoms of specific elements in different chemical compounds show a different resonance frequency which gives rise to the greatest utility of this phenomenon in analyzing the chemical structure of substances. Similar effects of the chemical environment permit the discrimination of different types of living tissue by virtue of their different chemical composition thus permitting utilization of the phenomenon in medical diagnostic instruments especially for magnetic resonance imaging.<br>

      nucleoside<br>
      A type of molecule found in all living organisms present mostly in chemically combined form as a component of nucleic acids and also in smaller amounts in free form consisting of a pentose sugar bound to a purine or pyrimidine base; two types of nucleoside ribonucleoside and deoxyribonucleoside are present. The most common bases present in nucleosides are adenine cytosine uracil guanine and thymine and to a lesser extent hypoxanthine and other bases are found. The most commmon ribonucleosides composed from these bases are called adenosine cytidine uridine and guanosine. The forms esterified with orthophosphoric at the 5-position of the pentose are called nucleotides. The nucleotides form the monomer units which are combined into DNA and RNA which carry the genetic information required for reproduction in all known organisms.<br>
