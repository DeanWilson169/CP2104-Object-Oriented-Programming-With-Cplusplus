The player holding a card having on it the set of numbers drawn from the wheel takes the stakes after a certain percentage of them has been deducted for the dealer. In some systems lesser prizes are awarded for having some but not all of the numbers selected such as four or five numbers in a six-number drawing. A variety of lotto is called keno. In another variety the player chooses the numbers for the card or ticket she holds. There may be from three to seven different numbers on a card or ticket. In a modern computerized lotto system conducted by state authorities the player chooses numbers or allows the computer to choose numbers at random which are then printed on a ticket that the player holds until the winning number is selected.<br>
