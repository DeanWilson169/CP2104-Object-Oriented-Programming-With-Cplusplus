      f<br>
      F is the sixth letter of the English alphabet and a nonvocal consonant. Its form and sound are from the Latin.

The form and value of Greek letter came from the Phoenician the ultimate source being probably Egyptian. Etymologically f is most closely related to p k v and b; as in E. five Gr. pe`nte; E. wolf L. lupus Gr. ly`kos; E. fox vixen ; fragile break; fruit brook v. t;  E. bear L. ferre.

      A tragedy by Goethe commenced in 1772 and published. as �Faust ein Fragment� in 1790. Part 1 complete was published as "Faust eine Tragodie" in 1808; part 2 finished in 1831 was published in 1833. It has been translated into English by Bayard Taylor Blackie Anster Hayward Martin and others (nearly 40 in all). Goethe accomplished the transformation of Faust from a common necromancer and conjurer into a personification of humanity tempted and disquieted but at length groping its way to the light. See Goethe;  An opera by Gounod (words after Goethe by Carre and Barbier) represented at the Theatre Lyrique Paris March 19 1859;  An opera by Spohr first produced at Frankfurt in 1818. The words which do not follow Goethe's play are by Bernhard;  an alchemist of German legend who sold his soul to the devil in exchange for knowledge;  Doctor Johann Faust a person born at Kundling (Knittlingen) Wurtemberg or at Roda near Weimar and said to have died in 1588. He was a man of licentious character a magician astrologer and soothsayer who boasted of performing the miracles of Christ. It was believed that he was carried off at last by the devil who had lived with him in the form of a black dog.<br>

      fungi<br>
      A group of thallophytic plant-like organisms of low organization destitute of chlorophyll in which reproduction is mainly accomplished by means of asexual spores which are produced in a great variety of ways though sexual reproduction is known to occur in certain Phycomycetes or so-called algal fungi. They include the molds mildews rusts smuts mushrooms toadstools puff balls and the allies of each. In the two-kingdom classification system they were classed with the plants but in the modern five-kingdom classification they are not classed as plants but are classed in their own separate kingdom fungi which includes the phyla Zygomycota (including simple fungi such as bread molds) Ascomycota (including the yeasts) Basidiomycota (including the mushrooms smuts and rusts) and Deuteromycota (the fungi imperfecti). Some of the forms such as the yeasts appear as single-celled microorganisms but all of the fungi are are eukaryotic thus distinguishing them from the prokaryotic microorganisms of the kingdon Monera.<br>
