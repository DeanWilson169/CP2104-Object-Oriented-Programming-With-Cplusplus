<p>c<br>
C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the Latin letter C which in old Latin represented the sounds of k and g (in go); its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words or Old English before the Norman Conquest it always has the sound of k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek G ? and came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the Phoenicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce and was derived probably through the French. Etymologically C is related to g h k q s (and other sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L. acutus E. acute ague; E. acrid eager vinegar; L. cornu E. horn; E. cat kitten; E. coy quiet; L. circare OF. cerchier E. search;  The keynote of the normal or �natural� scale which has neither flats nor sharps in its signature; also the third note of the relative minor scale of the same;  As a numeral C stands for Latin centum or 100 CC for 200 etc.<br>

It may be fatal but can be reversed or alleviated by returning the affected person to a high air pressure and then gradually decreasing the pressure to allow the gases to be released from the body fluids. It is a danger well known to divers. It is also called the bends and decompression sickness. It can be prevented in divers by a slow return to normal pressure or by using a breathing mixture of oxygen combined with a gas having low solubility in water such as helium.<br>

any of a class of chemical substances some of which have therapeutically useful antibacterial activity whose structure contains a beta-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring containing a sulfur and a nitrogen atom. The first of the series cephalosporin C was discovered by G. Brotzu in 1955 in the culture broth of a Cephalosporium species found off the coast of Sardinia. Other cephalosporins have been found to be produced by species of soil bacteria (actinomycetes). Many semisynthetic analogs have been tested for antibacterial effect and several of them have found use as important clinically useful antibacterial agents some of which may be taken orally for treatment of bacterial infections. The cephalosporins are the second class of beta-lactam antibiotic to be discovered the first being the penicillins and more recent classes being the thienamycins and sulfazecins. The cephamycins are a variant of cephalosporins with a methoxyl group on the beta-lactam ring rendering them more resistant to penicillinases. Among the cephalosporins which have been found clinically useful are cephalexin cephaloridine and cephalothin.<br>

Tissue which is capable of being stained by dyes;  The deeply staining substance of the nucleus and chromosomes of eukaryotic cells composed of DNA and basic proteins (such as histones) the DNA of which comprises the predominant physical basis of inheritance.

In most eukaryotic cells there is also DNA in certain plasmids such as mitochondria or (in plant cells) chloroplasts; but with the exception of these cytoplasmic genetic factors the nuclear DNA of the chromatin is believed to contain all the genetic information required to code for the development of an adult organism. In the interphase nucleus the chromosomes are dispersed but during cell division or meiosis they are condensed into the individually recognizable chromosomes. The set of chromosomes or a photographic representation of the full set of chromosomes of a cell (often ordered for presentation) is called a karyotype; The state of being colored as in the case of images formed by a lens; An abnormal coloring of plants.<br>

</p><p>circuit-breaker<br>
A device contained within an electrical circuit designed to interrupt the circuit when the current exceeds a preset value; it is sometimes called a contact breaker.

It differs from a fuse in not having a conducting element which melts (see 2nd fuse n.). Circuit breakers are designed to be easily reset i. e. to reclose the circuit after it has been opened by the circuit breaker; this is usually accomplished by simply moving a switch back and forth. They are commonly used in buildings to protect individual electrical lines and are often contained in groups within a box called a circuit breaker panel which divides the current from a main electrical line into multiple circuits each protected by a separate circuit breaker. Less commonly they may be found on individual devices.<br>
