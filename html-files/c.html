      c<br>
      C is the third letter of the English alphabet. It is from the Latin letter C which in old Latin represented the sounds of k and g (in go); its original value being the latter. In Anglo-Saxon words or Old English before the Norman Conquest it always has the sound of k. The Latin C was the same letter as the Greek G ? and came from the Greek alphabet. The Greeks got it from the Phoenicians. The English name of C is from the Latin name ce and was derived probably through the French. Etymologically C is related to g h k q s (and other sibilant sounds). Examples of these relations are in L. acutus E. acute ague; E. acrid eager vinegar; L. cornu E. horn; E. cat kitten; E. coy quiet; L. circare OF. cerchier E. search;  The keynote of the normal or �natural� scale which has neither flats nor sharps in its signature; also the third note of the relative minor scale of the same;  As a numeral C stands for Latin centum or 100 CC for 200 etc.<br>

      caisson-disease<br>
      A disease frequently induced by remaining for some time in an atmosphere of high pressure as in caissons diving bells etc. It is characterized by neuralgic pains and paralytic symptoms. It is caused by the release of bubbles of gas usually nitrogen from bodily fluids into the blood and tissues when a person having been in an environment with high air pressure moves to a lower pressure environment too rapidly for the excess dissolved gases to be released through normal breathing. It may be fatal but can be reversed or alleviated by returning the affected person to a high air pressure and then gradually decreasing the pressure to allow the gases to be released from the body fluids. It is a danger well known to divers. It is also called the bends and decompression sickness. It can be prevented in divers by a slow return to normal pressure or by using a breathing mixture of oxygen combined with a gas having low solubility in water such as helium.<br>

      cephalosporin<br>
      any of a class of chemical substances some of which have therapeutically useful antibacterial activity whose structure contains a beta-lactam ring fused to a six-membered ring containing a sulfur and a nitrogen atom. The first of the series cephalosporin C was discovered by G. Brotzu in 1955 in the culture broth of a Cephalosporium species found off the coast of Sardinia. Other cephalosporins have been found to be produced by species of soil bacteria (actinomycetes). Many semisynthetic analogs have been tested for antibacterial effect and several of them have found use as important clinically useful antibacterial agents some of which may be taken orally for treatment of bacterial infections. The cephalosporins are the second class of beta-lactam antibiotic to be discovered the first being the penicillins and more recent classes being the thienamycins and sulfazecins. The cephamycins are a variant of cephalosporins with a methoxyl group on the beta-lactam ring rendering them more resistant to penicillinases. Among the cephalosporins which have been found clinically useful are cephalexin cephaloridine and cephalothin.<br>

      Tissue which is capable of being stained by dyes;  The deeply staining substance of the nucleus and chromosomes of eukaryotic cells composed of DNA and basic proteins (such as histones) the DNA of which comprises the predominant physical basis of inheritance. It was at the beginning of the 20th century supposed to be the same substance as was then termed idioplasm or germ plasm. In most eukaryotic cells there is also DNA in certain plasmids such as mitochondria or (in plant cells) chloroplasts; but with the exception of these cytoplasmic genetic factors the nuclear DNA of the chromatin is believed to contain all the genetic information required to code for the development of an adult organism. In the interphase nucleus the chromosomes are dispersed but during cell division or meiosis they are condensed into the individually recognizable chromosomes. The set of chromosomes or a photographic representation of the full set of chromosomes of a cell (often ordered for presentation) is called a karyotype; The state of being colored as in the case of images formed by a lens; An abnormal coloring of plants.<br>

      chromatography<br>
      A treatise on colors;  an analytical and preparative technique for separating substances by differences in their selective adsorption to solids by passing a liquid over the solid to which the substances to be separated have usually been adsorbed in a preliminary step. The major variations are column chromatography in which the substances to be separated are adsorbed to a column with any of a wide variety of adsorbing solids in powdered or granulated form; paper chromatography in which the solids are applied as a spot at one end of a strip of absorbent paper (such as filter paper) and the liquid is percolated through the paper by capillary action; and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) which is similar to paper chromatography but the adsorbent material is instead of paper a thin layer of finely powdered material such as cellulose or silica on a backing of glass or plastic called a TLC plate. A modern version of column chromatography is high-performance liquid chromatography usually referred to as HPLC.<br>

      circuit-breaker<br>
      A device contained within an electrical circuit designed to interrupt the circuit when the current exceeds a preset value; it is sometimes called a contact breaker. Its function is to prevent fire or damage to the circuit or the devices on the circuit which could be caused by excess current such as that caused by a short-circuit. It differs from a fuse in not having a conducting element which melts (see 2nd fuse n.). Circuit breakers are designed to be easily reset i. e. to reclose the circuit after it has been opened by the circuit breaker; this is usually accomplished by simply moving a switch back and forth. They are commonly used in buildings to protect individual electrical lines and are often contained in groups within a box called a circuit breaker panel which divides the current from a main electrical line into multiple circuits each protected by a separate circuit breaker. Less commonly they may be found on individual devices.<br>

      clock<br>
      A machine for measuring time indicating the hour and other divisions; in ordinary mechanical clocks for domestic or office use the time is indicated on a typically circular face or dial plate containing two hands pointing to numbers engraved on the periphery of the face thus showing the hours and minutes. The works of a mechanical clock are moved by a weight or a spring and it is often so constructed as to tell the hour by the stroke of a hammer on a bell. In electrical or electronic clocks the time may be indicated as on a mechanical clock by hands but may also be indicated by direct digital readout with the hours and minutes in normal Arabic numerals. The readout using hands is often called analog to distinguish it from the digital readout. Some clocks also indicate the seconds. Clocks are not adapted like the watch to be carried on the person. Specialized clocks such as atomic clocks may be constructed on different principles and may have a very high precision for use in scientific observations;  A watch esp. one that strikes;  The striking of a clock;  A figure or figured work on the ankle or side of a stocking;  To ornament with figured work as the side of a stocking;  To call as a hen.

      coercion<br>
      The act or process of coercing;  The application to another of either physical or moral force.

At the same time coercion is not negatived by the fact of submission under force. �Coactus volui� (I consented under compulsion) is the condition of mind which when there is volition forced by coercion annuls the result of such coercion.<br>
