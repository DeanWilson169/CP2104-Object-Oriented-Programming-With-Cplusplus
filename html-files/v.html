      v<br>
      V the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet is a vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character U being the cursive form while V is better adapted for engraving as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel ? (see Y) this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F) or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u w f b p; as in vine wine; avoirdupois habit have; safe save; trover troubadour trope. See U F etc;  As a numeral V stands for five in English and Latin.<br>

      A statement propounded by the Danish philologist Karl Verner in 1875 which explains certain apparent exceptions to Grimm's law by the original position of the accent. Primitive Indo-European k t p became first in Teutonic h th f and appear without further change in old Teutonic if the accent rested on the preceding syllable; but these sounds became voiced and produced g d b if the accent was originally on a different syllable. Similarly s either remained unchanged or it became z and later r. Example: Skt. sapta (accent on ultima) Gr. 'e`pta Gothic sibun (seven). Examples in English are dead by the side of death to rise and to rear.<br>

The simplest viruses have no lipid envelope and may be considered as complex aggregates of molecules sometimes only a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and a coat protein. They are sometimes viewed as being on the borderline between living and nonliving objects. They are smaller than living cells in size usually between 20 and 300 nm; thus they pass through standard filters and were previously referred to as filterable virus. The manifestations of disease caused by multiplication of viruses in cells may be due to destruction of the cells caused by subversion of the cellular metabolic processes by the virus or by synthesis of a virus-specific toxin. Viruses may infect animals plants or microorganisms; those infecting bacteria are also called bacteriophages. Certain bacteriophages may be non-destructive and benign in the host; -- see bacteriophage;  Fig.: Any morbid corrupting quality in intellectual or moral conditions; something that poisons the mind or the soul; as the virus of obscene books;  a program or segment of program code that may make copies of itself (replicate) attach itself to other programs and perform unwanted actions within a computer; also called computer virus or virus program. Such programs are almost always introduced into a computer without the knowledge or assent of its owner and are often malicious causing destructive actions such as erasing data on disk but sometime only annoying causing peculiar objects to appear on the display. The form of sociopathic mental disease that causes a programmer to write such a program has not yet been given a name. Compare trojan horse{3}.<br>
