<p>v<br>
V the twenty-second letter of the English alphabet is a vocal consonant. V and U are only varieties of the same character U being the cursive form while V is better adapted for engraving as in stone. The two letters were formerly used indiscriminately and till a comparatively recent date words containing them were often classed together in dictionaries and other books of reference (see U). The letter V is from the Latin alphabet where it was used both as a consonant (about like English w) and as a vowel. The Latin derives it from a form (V) of the Greek vowel ? (see Y) this Greek letter being either from the same Semitic letter as the digamma F (see F) or else added by the Greeks to the alphabet which they took from the Semitic. Etymologically v is most nearly related to u w f b p; as in vine wine; avoirdupois habit have; safe save; trover troubadour trope. See U F etc;  As a numeral V stands for five in English and Latin.<br>
