      u<br>
      the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet is a cursive form of the letter V with which it was formerly used interchangeably both letters being then used both as vowels and consonants. U and V are now however differentiated U being used only as a vowel or semivowel and V only as a consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U in Anglo-Saxon was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages of Europe that of long oo as in tool and short oo as in wood answering to the French ou in tour. Etymologically U is most closely related to o y (vowel) w and v; as in two duet dyad twice; top tuft; sop sup; auspice aviary. See V also O and Y.<br>

(b) To nouns to form verbs expressing privation of the thing quality or state expressed by the noun or separation from it; as in unchild unsex.

Un- is sometimes used with an intensive force merely; as in unloose;  An inseparable prefix or particle signifying not; in-; non-. In- is prefixed mostly to words of Latin origin or else to words formed by Latin suffixes; un- is of much wider application and is attached at will to almost any adjective or participle used adjectively or adverb from which it may be desired to form a corresponding negative adjective or adverb and is also but less freely prefixed to nouns. Un- sometimes has merely an intensive force; as in unmerciless unremorseless; Un- is prefixed to adjectives or to words used adjectively; To adjectives to denote the absence of the quality designated by the adjective; To past particles or to adjectives formed after the analogy of past particles to indicate the absence of the condition or state expressed by them; To present participles which come from intransitive verbs or are themselves employed as adjectives to mark the absence of the activity disposition or condition implied by the participle;; Those which have acquired an opposed or contrary instead of a merely negative meaning; as unfriendly ungraceful unpalatable unquiet and the like; or else an intensive sense more than a prefixed not would express; as unending unparalleled undisciplined undoubted unsafe and the like; Those which have the value of independent words inasmuch as the simple words are either not used at all or are rarely or at least much less frequently used; as unavoidable unconscionable undeniable unspeakable unprecedented unruly and the like; or inasmuch as they are used in a different sense from the usual meaning of the primitive or especially in one of the significations of the latter; as unaccountable unalloyed unbelieving unpretending unreserved and the like; or inasmuch as they are so frequently and familiarly used that they are hardly felt to be of negative origin; as uncertain uneven and the like; Those which are anomalous provincial or for some other reason not desirable to be used and are so indicated; as unpure for impure unsatisfaction for dissatisfaction unexpressible for inexpressible and the like; Un- is prefixed to nouns to express the absence of or the contrary of that which the noun signifies; as unbelief unfaith unhealth unrest untruth and the like.<br>
