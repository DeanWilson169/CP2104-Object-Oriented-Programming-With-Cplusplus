<p>u<br>
the twenty-first letter of the English alphabet is a cursive form of the letter V with which it was formerly used interchangeably both letters being then used both as vowels and consonants. U and V are now however differentiated U being used only as a vowel or semivowel and V only as a consonant. The true primary vowel sound of U in Anglo-Saxon was the sound which it still retains in most of the languages of Europe that of long oo as in tool and short oo as in wood answering to the French ou in tour. Etymologically U is most closely related to o y (vowel) w and v; as in two duet dyad twice; top tuft; sop sup; auspice aviary. See V also O and Y.<br>
