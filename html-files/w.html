      w<br>
      the twenty-third letter of the English alphabet is usually a consonant but sometimes it is a vowel forming the second element of certain diphthongs as in few how. It takes its written form and its name from the repetition of a V this being the original form of the Roman capital letter which we call U. Etymologically it is most related to v and u. See V and U. Some of the uneducated classes in England especially in London confuse w and v substituting the one for the other as weal for veal and veal for weal; wine for vine and vine for wine etc. See Guide to Pronunciation �� 266-268.<br>
