      the eighth letter of the English alphabet is classed among the consonants and is formed with the mouth organs in the same position as that of the succeeding vowel. It is used with certain consonants to form digraphs representing sounds which are not found in the alphabet as sh th ? as in shall thing ?ine (for zh see �274); also to modify the sounds of some other letters as when placed after c and p with the former of which it represents a compound sound like that of tsh as in charm (written also tch as in catch) with the latter the sound of f as in phase phantom. In some words mostly derived or introduced from foreign languages h following c and g indicates that those consonants have the hard sound before e i and y as in chemistry chiromancy chyle Ghent Ghibelline etc;  in some others ch has the sound of sh as in chicane. See Guide to Pronunciation �� 153 179 181-3 237-8;  The seventh degree in the diatonic scale being used by the Germans for B natural. See B.<br>

      half-life<br>
      the time it takes for one-half of a substance decaying in a first-order reaction to be destroyed. For radioactive substances it is the time required for one-half of the initial amount of the radioactive isotope to decay. The half-lifeis a measure of the rate of the reaction being observed. For processes that are true first-order processes such as radioactive decay the half-life is independent of the quantity of material present and it is thus a constant. The time it takes for one-half the remaining quantity of a radioactive isotope to decay will be the same regardless of how far the decay process has advanced. Some chemical reactions are also first order and may be characterized as having a half-life. However for chemical reactions the half-life will depend upon temperature and in some cases other environmental conditions whereas for radioactive isotopes the rate of decay is largely independent of the environment.<br>

      helium<br>
      An inert monoatomic gaseous element occurring in the atmosphere of the sun and stars and in small quantities in the earth's atmosphere in several minerals and in certain mineral waters. It is obtained from natural gas in industrial quantities. Symbol He; atomic number 2; at. wt. 4.0026 (C=12.011). Helium was first detected spectroscopically in the sun by Lockyer in 1868; it was first prepared by Ramsay in 1895. Helium has a density of 1.98 compared with hydrogen and is more difficult to liquefy than the latter. Chemically it is an inert noble gas belonging to the argon group and cannot be made to form compounds. The helium nucleus is the charged particle which constitutes alpha rays and helium is therefore formed as a decomposition product of certain radioactive substances such as radium. The normal helium nucleus has two protons and two neutrons but an isotope with only one neutron is also observed in atmospheric helium at an abundance of 0.013 %. Liquid helium has a boiling point of -268.9� C at atmospheric pressure and is used for maintaining very low temperatures both in laboratory experimentation and in commercial applications to maintain superconductivity in low-temperature superconducting devices. Gaseous helium at normal temperatures is used for buoyancy in blimps dirigibles and high-altitude balloons and also for amusement in party balloons.<br>

The simplest viruses have no lipid envelope and may be considered as complex aggregates of molecules sometimes only a nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) and a coat protein. They are sometimes viewed as being on the borderline between living and nonliving objects. They are smaller than living cells in size usually between 20 and 300 nm; thus they pass through standard filters and were previously referred to as filterable virus. The manifestations of disease caused by multiplication of viruses in cells may be due to destruction of the cells caused by subversion of the cellular metabolic processes by the virus or by synthesis of a virus-specific toxin. Viruses may infect animals plants or microorganisms; those infecting bacteria are also called bacteriophages. Certain bacteriophages may be non-destructive and benign in the host; -- see bacteriophage;  Fig.: Any morbid corrupting quality in intellectual or moral conditions; something that poisons the mind or the soul; as the virus of obscene books;  a program or segment of program code that may make copies of itself (replicate) attach itself to other programs and perform unwanted actions within a computer; also called computer virus or virus program. Such programs are almost always introduced into a computer without the knowledge or assent of its owner and are often malicious causing destructive actions such as erasing data on disk but sometime only annoying causing peculiar objects to appear on the display. The form of sociopathic mental disease that causes a programmer to write such a program has not yet been given a name. Compare trojan horse{3}.<br>
