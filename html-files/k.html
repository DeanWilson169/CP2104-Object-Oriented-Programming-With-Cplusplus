In November 1993 the nomenclature committe of the American Chemical Society approved the name rutherfordium for element 104. Russsian investigators who claim to have first discovered element 104 isotope 260 (half-life 0.3 seconds) in 1964 at Dubna proposed the name kurchatovium. However investigators at Berkely in 1969 produced several isotopes of element 104 but were unable to produce isotope 260; they reported finding isotope 257 with a half-life of 4-5 seconds isotope 259 with a half-life of 3-4 seconds and isotope 258 with a shorter half-life.<br>
