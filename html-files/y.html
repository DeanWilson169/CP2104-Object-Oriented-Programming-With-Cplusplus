The act granting the land was repealed in 1796 by a new legislature and the repealing provision was incorporated in the State constitution in 1798. In 1802 the territory was ceded to the United States. The claims of the purchasers whom Georgia had refused to compensate were sustained by the United States Supreme Court which (1810) declared the repealing act of 1796 unconstitutional. Congress in 1814 ordered the lands sold and appropriated $5000000 to pay the claims.<br>
