</p><p>t-cell<br>
A type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and provides cell-mediated immunity for the organism protecting against infecting cells or the body's own malignant cells; also called T lymphocyte. There are several types of T cells. They develop as do B cells from progenitor cells in the bone marrow but are distinguished from B-cells (B-lymphocytes) by their site of differentiation; T-cells mature in the thymus and B-cells in the bone marrow (in birds in the Bursa of Fabricius). They also have different antigen receptors from those of B-cells. T-cells differentiate into cells that can directly kill infecting cells (cell-mediated immunity cytotoxity) or activate other cells of the immune system (helper T cells) whereas B-cells differentiate on activation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Helper T cells interact with B-cells by secreting lymphokines that stimulate the B cell which have detected a foreign antigen to enter the cell cycle and develop by repeated mitosis into a clone of cells with identical receptors and then to secrete antibodies to that specific antigen.<br>

</p><p>tide<br>
Time; period; season;  The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean and of bays rivers etc. connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day or the space of a little more than twenty-four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former) acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition as at new moon and full moon their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide called the spring tide as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual called the neap tide;  A stream; current; flood; as a tide of blood;  Tendency or direction of causes influences or events; course; current;  Violent confluence;  The period of twelve hours;  To cause to float with the tide; to drive or carry with the tide or stream;  To betide; to happen; To pour a tide or flood; To work into or out of a river or harbor by drifting with the tide and anchoring when it becomes adverse.<br>

</p><p>tontine-insurance<br>
Insurance in which the benefits of the insurance are distributed upon the tontine principle. Under the old or full tontine plan all benefits were forfeited on lapsed policies on the policies of those who died within the tontine period only the face of the policy was paid without any share of the surplus and the survivor at the end of the tontine period received the entire surplus. This plan of tontine insurance has been replaced in the United States by the semitontine plan in which the surplus is divided among the holders of policies in force at the termination of the tontine period but the reverse for the paid-up value is paid on lapsed policies and on the policies of those that have died the face is paid. Other modified forms are called free tontine deferred dividend etc. according to the nature of the tontine arrangement.<br>
