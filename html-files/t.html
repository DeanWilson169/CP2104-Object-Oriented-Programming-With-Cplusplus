      t-cell<br>
      A type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and provides cell-mediated immunity for the organism protecting against infecting cells or the body's own malignant cells; also called T lymphocyte. There are several types of T cells. They develop as do B cells from progenitor cells in the bone marrow but are distinguished from B-cells (B-lymphocytes) by their site of differentiation; T-cells mature in the thymus and B-cells in the bone marrow (in birds in the Bursa of Fabricius). They also have different antigen receptors from those of B-cells. T-cells differentiate into cells that can directly kill infecting cells (cell-mediated immunity cytotoxity) or activate other cells of the immune system (helper T cells) whereas B-cells differentiate on activation into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Helper T cells interact with B-cells by secreting lymphokines that stimulate the B cell which have detected a foreign antigen to enter the cell cycle and develop by repeated mitosis into a clone of cells with identical receptors and then to secrete antibodies to that specific antigen.<br>

Both asexual and sexual reproduction often of a complex type occur in these forms. The Thallophyta exist almost exclusively as gametophytes the sporophyte being absent or rudimentary. By those who do not separate the Myxophyta from the Tallophyta as a distinct phylum the latter is treated as the lowermost group in the vegetable kingdom.<br>

      tide<br>
      Time; period; season;  The alternate rising and falling of the waters of the ocean and of bays rivers etc. connected therewith. The tide ebbs and flows twice in each lunar day or the space of a little more than twenty-four hours. It is occasioned by the attraction of the sun and moon (the influence of the latter being three times that of the former) acting unequally on the waters in different parts of the earth thus disturbing their equilibrium. A high tide upon one side of the earth is accompanied by a high tide upon the opposite side. Hence when the sun and moon are in conjunction or opposition as at new moon and full moon their action is such as to produce a greater than the usual tide called the spring tide as represented in the cut. When the moon is in the first or third quarter the sun's attraction in part counteracts the effect of the moon's attraction thus producing under the moon a smaller tide than usual called the neap tide;  A stream; current; flood; as a tide of blood;  Tendency or direction of causes influences or events; course; current;  Violent confluence;  The period of twelve hours;  To cause to float with the tide; to drive or carry with the tide or stream;  To betide; to happen; To pour a tide or flood; To work into or out of a river or harbor by drifting with the tide and anchoring when it becomes adverse.<br>

      tin<br>
      An elementary substance found as an oxide in the mineral cassiterite and reduced as a soft silvery-white crystalline metal with a tinge of yellowish-blue and a high luster. It is malleable at ordinary temperatures but brittle when heated. It is softer than gold and can be beaten out into very thin strips called tinfoil. It is ductile at 2120 when it can be drawn out into wire which is not very tenacious; it melts at 4420 and at a higher temperature burns with a brilliant white light. Air and moisture act on tin very slightly. The peculiar properties of tin especially its malleability its brilliancy and the slowness with which it rusts make it very serviceable. With other metals it forms valuable alloys as bronze gun metal bell metal pewter and solder. It is not easily oxidized in the air and is used chiefly to coat iron to protect it from rusting in the form of tin foil with mercury to form the reflective surface of mirrors and in solder bronze speculum metal and other alloys. Its compounds are designated as stannous or stannic. Symbol Sn (Stannum). Atomic weight 117.4;  Thin plates of iron covered with tin; tin plate;  Money;  To cover with tin or tinned iron or to overlay with tin foil.<br>

      to<br>
      The preposition to primarily indicates approach and arrival motion made in the direction of a place or thing and attaining it access; and also motion or tendency without arrival; movement toward; -- opposed to from;  Hence it indicates motion course or tendency toward a time a state or condition an aim or anything capable of being regarded as a limit to a tendency movement or action; as he is going to a trade; he is rising to wealth and honor;  In a very general way and with innumerable varieties of application to connects transitive verbs with their remoter or indirect object and adjectives nouns and neuter or passive verbs with a following noun which limits their action. Its sphere verges upon that of for but it contains less the idea of design or appropriation; as these remarks were addressed to a large audience; let us keep this seat to ourselves; a substance sweet to the taste; an event painful to the mind; duty to God and to our parents; a dislike to spirituous liquor;  As sign of the infinitive to had originally the use of last defined governing the infinitive as a verbal noun and connecting it as indirect object with a preceding verb or adjective; thus ready to go i.e. ready unto going; good to eat i.e. good for eating; I do my utmost to lead my life pleasantly. But it has come to be the almost constant prefix to the infinitive even in situations where it has no prepositional meaning as where the infinitive is direct object or subject; thus I love to learn i.e. I love learning; to die for one's country is noble i.e. the dying for one's country. Where the infinitive denotes the design or purpose good usage formerly allowed the prefixing of for to the to; as what went ye out for see? (Matt. xi. 8);  In many phrases and in connection with many other words to has a pregnant meaning or is used elliptically;  Effect; end; consequence; as the prince was flattered to his ruin; he engaged in a war to his cost; violent factions exist to the prejudice of the state;  Accord; adaptation; as an occupation to his taste; she has a husband to her mind;  Comparison; as three is to nine as nine is to twenty-seven; it is ten to one that you will offend him;  Addition; union; accumulation;  Accompaniment; as she sang to his guitar; they danced to the music of a piano;  Character; condition of being; purpose subserved or office filled.<br>

      tontine-insurance<br>
      Insurance in which the benefits of the insurance are distributed upon the tontine principle. Under the old or full tontine plan all benefits were forfeited on lapsed policies on the policies of those who died within the tontine period only the face of the policy was paid without any share of the surplus and the survivor at the end of the tontine period received the entire surplus. This plan of tontine insurance has been replaced in the United States by the semitontine plan in which the surplus is divided among the holders of policies in force at the termination of the tontine period but the reverse for the paid-up value is paid on lapsed policies and on the policies of those that have died the face is paid. Other modified forms are called free tontine deferred dividend etc. according to the nature of the tontine arrangement.<br>

      trituberculy<br>
      A theory of the development of mammalian molar teeth. The primitive stage is that of simple cones as in reptiles. The simple cone then developed a smaller cone in front and another behind. Next a cingulum was developed and the three cones became arranged in a triangle the two smaller cusps having moved to the outer side in upper and to the inner in lower molars. This primitive triangle is called the trigon or trigonid and this stage the tritubercular or trigonodont. The trigon being a cutting apparatus an extension of the posterior part of the crown was developed in lower molars for crushing and a smaller corresponding part appeared in upper molars. Another large cone then arose usually from the cingulum. In more complex forms smaller intermediate cusps appeared.<br>

      A constitutional disease caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (also called the Tubercle bacillus) characterized by the production of tubercles in the internal organs and especially in the lungs where it constitutes the most common variety of pulmonary phthisis (consumption). The Mycobacteria are slow-growing and without cell walls and are thus not affected by the beta-lactam antibiotics; treatment is difficult usually requiring simultaneous administration of multiple antibiotics to effect a cure. Prior to availability of antibiotic treatment the cure required extensive rest for which special sanatoriums were constructed.<br>
