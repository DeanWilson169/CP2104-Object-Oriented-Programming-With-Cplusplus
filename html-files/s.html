      s<br>
      the nineteenth letter of the English alphabet is a consonant and is often called a sibilant in allusion to its hissing sound. It has two principal sounds; one a mere hissing as in sack this; the other a vocal hissing (the same as that of z) as in is wise. Besides these it sometimes has the sounds of sh and zh as in sure measure. It generally has its hissing sound at the beginning of words but in the middle and at the end of words its sound is determined by usage. In a few words it is silent as in isle debris. With the letter h it forms the digraph sh. See Guide to pronunciation �� 255-261;  A contraction for is or (colloquially) for has.<br>

      shall<br>
      To owe; to be under obligation for;  To be obliged; must;  As an auxiliary shall indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation is derived from the person speaking; as you shall go; he shall go; that is I order or promise your going. It thus ordinarily expresses in the second and third persons a command a threat or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized the command is made more imperative the promise or that more positive and sure. It is also employed in the language of prophecy; as �the day shall come when . . .  � since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person the necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than in the speaker; as I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is always a less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated by will. �I shall go� implies nearly a simple futurity; more exactly a foretelling or an expectation of my going in which naturally enough a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize the shall and the event is described as certain to occur and the expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic �I will go.� In a question the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course transferred to the person addressed; as �Shall you go?� (answer �I shall go�); �Shall he go?� i. e. �Do you require or promise his going?� (answer �He shall go�.) The same relation is transferred to either second or third person in such phrases as �You say or think you shall go;� �He says or thinks he shall go.� After a conditional conjunction (as if whether) shall is used in all persons to express futurity simply; as if I you or he shall say they are right. Should is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall as its imperfect. It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as he should do it whether he will or not. In the early English and hence in our English Bible shall is the auxiliary mainly used in all the persons to express simple futurity. (Cf. Will v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically; thus with an adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be omitted.<br>

      slide-rule<br>
      a thin flat calculating device consisting of a fixed outer piece and a movable middle piece. Both pieces are graduated in such a way (as by a logarithmic scale) that multiplication division and other mathematical functions of an input variable may be rapidly determined by movement of the middle pieces to a location on one scale corresponding to the input value and reading off the result on another scale. A movable window with a hairline assists in alignment of the scales. This device has been largely superseded by the electronic calculator which has a greater precision than the slide rule. Also called colloquially slipstick.<br>

      An unusual fungus-like protist of the phylum Myxomycota or the class Myxomycetes having a stage of growth in which it comprises a naked noncellular multinucleate mass of creeping protoplasm having characteristics of both plants and animals; it also has a propagative phase in which it develops fruiting bodies bearing spores; it is sometimes classified as a protist. It is called also acellular slime mold;  Any of several remarkable amoebalike organisms of the phylum Acrasiomycota mostly terrestrial having a fruiting phase resembling that of the acellular slime molds but being cellular and nucleate throughout their life cycle; called also cellular slime mold. The most studied species is Dictyostelium discoideum. In their feeding phase they live like amoebae as individual cells engulfing bacteria as a prime food source. When the food source diminishes they begin to aggregate swarming together to form clumps which may move toward heat and light so as to reach the surface of the ground; they then differentiate into a form with spores contained within a sporangium resting on a stalk. When the spores are carried to another location with adequate food supplies the spores may germinate to resume the life cycle. The phase of aggregation appears to be initiated by release of cyclic AMP serving as a signal between the individual cells. The formation of the fruiting body has some similarities to differentiation in multicellular organisms but the mechanisms are still under study. Some biologists object to the classification of Dictyostelium as a slime mold as it is neither a mold nor slimy.<br>

      sloop<br>
      A vessel having one mast and fore-and-aft rig consisting of a boom-and-gaff mainsail jibs staysail and gaff topsail. The typical sloop has a fixed bowsprit topmast and standing rigging while those of a cutter are capable of being readily shifted. The sloop usually carries a centerboard and depends for stability upon breadth of beam rather than depth of keel. The two types have rapidly approximated since 1880. One radical distinction is that a sloop may carry a centerboard. See Cutter and Illustration in Appendix;  In modern usage a sailing vessel having one mast commonly with a Bermuda rig with either a center-board or a keel. In the United States a sloop may have one or two headsails while in Western Europe and Great Britain a sloop has only one headsail.<br>

      string-theory<br>
      A mathematical theory for describing the properties of fundamental particles which represents the particles as one-dimensional string-like objects which exist in the normal four dimensions of space-time plus additional dimensions the total dimensions being ten eleven or twenty-six depending on the version of the theory. The properties of fundamental particles in string theory and their manner of interaction with each other depend upon the modes of vibration of the strings{17}. The attractiveness of this theory rests in part on its ability to provide a unified treatment of gravity as well as the three other basic forces of nature in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics. The great difficulty of doing the calculations required by the theory however has thus far (1999) made it impossible to calculate the observable properties such as the mass of known particles such as the electron proton mesons quarks and neutron; thus there is as yet no experimental verification for the theory. The most popular version of the theory depends on a mathematical property called supersymmetry and the theory derived form this principle is properly called superstring theory a term which is often used interchangeably with string theory.

      swastika<br>
      A symbol or ornament in the form of a Greek cross with the ends of the arms at right angles all in the same direction and each prolonged to the height of the parallel arm of the cross. A great many modified forms exist ogee and volute as well as rectilinear while various decorative designs as Greek fret or meander are derived from or closely associated with it. The swastika is found in remains from the Bronze Age in various parts of Europe esp. at Hissarlik (Troy) and was in frequent use as late as the 10th century. It is found in ancient Persia in India where both Jains and Buddhists used (or still use) it as religious symbol in China and Japan and among Indian tribes of North Central and South America. It is usually thought to be a charm talisman or religious token esp. a sign of good luck or benediction. Max MuLler distinguished from the swastika with arms prolonged to the right the suavastika with arms prolonged to the left but this distinction is not commonly recognized. Other names for the swastika are fylfot and gammadion.<br>
