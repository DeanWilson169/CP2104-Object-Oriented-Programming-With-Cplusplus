      q<br>
      the seventeenth letter of the English alphabet has but one sound (that of k) and is always followed by u the two letters together being sounded like kw except in some words in which the u is silent. See Guide to Pronunciation � 249. Q is not found in Anglo-Saxon cw being used instead of qu; as in cwic quick; cwen queen. The name (ku) is from the French ku which is from the Latin name of the same letter; its form is from the Latin which derived it through a Greek alphabet from the Phoenician the ultimate origin being Egyptian.<br>
